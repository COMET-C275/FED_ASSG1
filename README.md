FED Assignment 1 project

Writeup on FED Project Idea


Name: Codi Chew
Student ID: S10241842
Class: T07

Introduction:
My project idea for FED Assignment 1 revolves around the revitalizing Crye Precision, a non-fictional company based in Brooklyn, New York. Crye Precision specializes in constructing high quality, comfortable, and functional tactical garments, which earned them global recognition for its cutting-edge and uncompromising gear. Being renowned as a pioneer in the industry, Crye consistently produces avant-garde apparel that is trusted and worn by many of the world’s best militaries.

External user’s goal:
Crye Precision has several customers ranging from civilians to law enforcement officers and military personnel. Their primary goal is to see what gear Crye has to offer and whether they are made with high-quality materials as Crye claims. Thus, the website must be simple to use and navigate so that customers are able to swiftly find the specific equipment they are searching for while being able to easily browse the various products Crye has to offer. Furthermore, customers might also like to find out more about the company and would like to know certain information such as which countries Crye can ship to, what credit cards they accept, and other links that are related to the company such as social-media platforms. 

Site owner’s goal:
The goal of Crye’s owner is to appeal to the customers by earning their trust and confidence so that they would purchase Crye’s product while simultaneously boosting Crye’s reputation as a reputable, trustworthy, and are capable of consistently producing high-quality garments.
Potential features to include:
-	Make the website more compartmentalized for new potential customers.
-	Gain the customer’s trust by providing them with unbiased customer reviews.
-	Link reviews about the product on the page.
-	Have a page that informs users of where Crye can ship while providing an estimated cost.
-	Offer a drop-down list where users can select multiple language options.
-	Offer a loyalty program by signing up to be a member.
-	Have a slideshow on the landing page to feature new products.
-	Include a color chart so people know what color of garments are suitable for them.
-	Offer a sign-up link for a newsletter on the sign-up page.
-	Show a list of credit cards that are accepted by the company.
-	Feature additional links that are related to the company such as social media platforms like Instagram etc.
-	Include a promotional video for the landing page.
-	Offer special discounts and access pages for Military and Law enforcement programs where they can have early access to equipment for testing.

Suggested JavaScript features to include:
-	The navigation bar features a color change on the option when the mouse is hovering.
-	Certain options will have a color change or have an object popping out while the mouse is hovering to indicate that the user can select that option.
